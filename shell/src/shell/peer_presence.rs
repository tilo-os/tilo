//! Peer pointers, from an app in a room to the compositor drawing it.
//!
//! Every quick-ui app publishes its pointer to the collaboration
//! broker, scoped to the room it was launched into. Until now nothing
//! read those frames except the other apps: the shell hosts the broker
//! but was not a subscriber to it, so `PresenceCtx::pointers` was empty
//! in every native session and the overlay that paints peers had
//! nothing to paint.
//!
//! This module closes both halves of that.
//!
//! **Outbound.** A [`RoomSubscription`] on the broker delivers the
//! presence its local apps publish, addressed by room through the
//! broker's own [`CrdtRoute::delivers_to`]. Each pointer frame is
//! republished to the room's other hosts as *this session's* cursor.
//!
//! Two things follow from republishing per session rather than per
//! connection, and both matter on screen:
//!
//! - **One person is one cursor.** The broker mints a user id per
//!   *connection*, so a person with two windows open is two ids
//!   locally. Those ids never leave the host; what goes on the wire is
//!   the session, which is the person. A cursor that moves from one
//!   app to another is therefore one cursor moving, not a second one
//!   appearing.
//! - **The coordinate is the one on screen.** An app reports its
//!   pointer in *surface-local* coordinates, which say nothing about
//!   where the pointer is on the desktop — the same (40, 30) is a
//!   different place in every window. Only the compositor knows that,
//!   so the compositor supplies it. The app's frame is what says
//!   *someone is pointing inside a shared app in this room*; the
//!   session says where. That is also what makes the crossing work:
//!   as the pointer leaves one app and enters another, the publisher
//!   changes and the position keeps tracking, so peers see one
//!   continuous cursor.
//!
//! **Inbound.** [`PeerPresence::pump`] drains what arrived from other
//! hosts and folds it in through
//! [`ui::presence::PresenceCtx::apply_remote_presence`] — the same
//! decode an app runs — so a peer painted by the compositor and a peer
//! painted inside an app are the same peer, arrived by the same route.
