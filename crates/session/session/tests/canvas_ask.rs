//! Text typed on the canvas that asks (`docs/designs/app-language/shell.md` §8.1,
//! "Asking from the canvas").
//!
//! The canvas entry reads "Find something, or ask". A line that finds something
//! places it, as it always did (`arrangement_placing.rs`). A line that is a
//! question, or that names nothing, is not refused: the session posts it as the
//! person into their ask conversation with the agent the workspace keeps, and
//! that conversation stands where they typed, so the person sees what they asked
//! in the place that asked it.
//!
//! Every step here is the production path: the canvas entry's own
//! `place-found` action on `shell:arrangement`, the session's Chat record opened
//! through the same store every app of the workspace opens, and Chat's own
//! `create-channel-with-id` and `post` on it. Nothing here writes Chat's state by
//! hand; the record is read back from the store as a window would read it.
//!
//! What is stubbed: the agent itself. This file proves the ask reaches the
//! conversation — the channel exists, it takes the kept agent as a participant,
//! and it holds the person's message — which is exactly the turn
//! `conversations.rs` derives and the broker delivers.
