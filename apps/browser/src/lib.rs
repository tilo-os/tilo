//! Quick Browser library root. The binary is a thin shim over the
//! `BrowserWidget` exported here so the `--shots` mode can construct
//! the whole chrome without booting an event loop.
//!
//! The browser is deliberately small: it is chrome (address bar,
//! navigation, progress, filter loading) around the `ui` toolkit's
//! `WebView` widget. The web engine itself lives behind
//! `ui::webview::WebViewEngine`; there is no tab UI — tabbing is the
//! compositor's `WindowGroup` frame primitive.

// An app runs as its own sandboxed process, so an integer that wraps here
// costs one app rather than the desktop, and proving every layout sum cannot
// overflow is a tax a third-party app author would pay too. The lints that
// produce a *crash* stay denied — indexing_slicing, string_slice,
// unwrap_used, expect_used, panic — because a panicking app is a bad app
// whoever wrote it. `shell`, `ui` and everything under `crates/` keep the
// full set: a fault there takes the session, or every app with it.
